===================

Some experimenting with Arduino Uno

This repo contains a sketch that reads temperature and brightness sensor information.
It also provides an interface for displaying user-defined RGB colors on an RGB LED on the arduino board.

At last, there's a webserver and a web UI which builds the bridge between the user and the Arduino board.

Just build the server using MonoDevelop, and hang in the arduino on /dev/ttyACM0 and it'll work.
